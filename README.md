### WINDOWS
- Install [ADB](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip). If you want ADB support everywhere on your PC, you need to add the path of the ADB folder in the system variables (see [this](https://www.xda-developers.com/adb-fastboot-any-directory-windows-linux/)).

- Go to the [release section](https://github.com/KelvinCrag/backupconfirm/releases) and download the lastest release.

- Put .bat in the same folder of installed adb. By default it is c:/adb/platform-tools et voil√† !
